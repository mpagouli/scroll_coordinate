Scroll Coordinate
==================

Analogous of drag_coordinate for scrolling: Having several divs containing larger divs inside them, scroll_coordinate gives the ability to coordinate the scrolling of the parent divs on their child divs, in several ways. Scrolling of one element can cause automatic dragging of other elements inside their parents or scrolling of other elements on their children.
